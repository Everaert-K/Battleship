 Project from 2nd year of university where we created, in a team of 5 students, a program that can beat players in the game battleship.
 ! The documentation of this application contains a lot of Dutch, there is however a Demo available under the map Demo !
  
## Intro
The goal of battleship is to sink all the boats of your opponent before your oponent manages to sink your boats. During this project we used [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news).

## Features of the game
